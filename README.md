# change-mac-address
Change mac adress script
To use this script, you would need to save it to a file (e.g. change_mac.py) and then run it with root privileges (sudo python3 change_mac.py). Note that this script assumes that you're using Linux and that your network interface is named eth0. You may need to modify the script to work with a different interface name or operating system.
